            <h2>Step 4</h2>
            <h4>Cutting time</h4>
            <p>After giving the doggo sometime to rest and relaxation, now its time for the real thing. Be extremely careful if you use scissors to avoid injuring yourself or your pet. Try to 
                <br>cut parallel to the growth of the hair to avoid a choppy look. 
            </p>

            <p>Next thing is to Clear out the doggo's eyes. A healthy eye should be clear and should not show any signs of >irritation or unusual discharge. Don't try to trim hair away from the eyes 
                <br>yourself, as you might injure your pet. Ask your vet or groomer to do it for you.
            </p>

            <p>Afterwards, the doggo's ear. It's normal for a clean ear to have some wax in it, but there shouldn't be any particular smell to it. To clean your dog's ears, apply some ear cleaning 
                <br>solution Wipe dirt and wax away from the inner ear, but don't rub vigorously, as this might cause sores. Don't push too far into the ear, either. If your dog has drop ears like 
                <br>a basset hound, wipe the inside of the ear flag as dirt collects there as well. The groomers rule of thumb is to clean only what you can see.</p>
