                                    <p> Five top trends for 2021 in Artificial Intelligence and Machine
                                        <br> Learning (AI/ML) for staying ahead of the curve. What is 
                                        <br> important for being effective for applying algorithms in coding 
                                        <br>to utilize data to solve problems? 
                                    </p>
                                    <p><b>Blockchain,</b> is a technology that uses a sequential set of 
                                        <br>transaction leaving a defined register of events and process 
                                        <br>for combining tasks. Fusing AI/ML and blockchain for data
                                        <br> solutions is coming.</p>
                                    <p><b>Cloud</b> is scalable and virtual environments. These are available
                                        <br> to set users with no physical location or provision requirement.
                                        <br> Cloud creates a difficult model for IT and data services by not 
                                        <br>restricting architecture by physical requirements.</p>
                                    <p><b>Interoperability,</b> using APIs and libraries together through 
                                        <br> replication  or scripting across stacks for easy implementations.
                                        <br>Having reusable and expandable blocks for coding across
                                        <br> platforms such as Amazon Web services, Microsoft Azure, SAP,
                                        <br> Snowflake, and more.</p>
                                    <p><b>Security,</b> keeping data safe through stewardship. Borth Innovation
                                        <br> and workflow will be a topic for 2021 to enhance Security

                                        <br>Intelligence and Machine Learning to differentiate from software

                                    <p>Big Data, Machine Learning, and the Internet of Things (IoT)
                                        <br>were the biggest educational technology trends of 2019. However,
                                        <br>distance learning has become the one trend that rules them all.
                                        <br>The COVID-19 pandemic has drastically changed the way we teach
                                        <br>and learn. Students now have to get used to distance learning
                                        <br>via digital platforms due to social distancing. Even though some
                                        <br>schools are reopening, this trend may continue until 2021. The
