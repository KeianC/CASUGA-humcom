                <h2><u>ABOUT</u></h2>
                <h4>What is 3 Point Perspective?</h4>
                <p>
                    Three point perspective is a form of linear perspective that utilizes three vanishing points in which forms utilize each of the 3 vanishing points to convey the
                    <br>illusion of depth on a two-dimensional surface.
                </p>
                <p>LWhile most three point perspective drawings utilize geometric subject matter such as buildings, cubes, and other rectangular prisms the technique is also useful 
                    <br>for more organic forms too.
                <p>Keeping an understanding of perspective in ones mind helps an artist to appropriately size out objects.  This helps artists create a realistic look of depth even 
                    <br>though they are working on a flat piece of paper or canvas.</p>

                <h2><u>Rules of perspective: true shapes, vanishing points and horizon lines</u></h2>
                <p>In one point perspective, surfaces that face the viewer appear as their true shape, without any distortion. They are drawn using primarily horizontal and 
                    <br>vertical lines, as illustrated by the diagram below:</p>

                <h3>Vanishing Point and Horizon Line</h3>
                <p>The vanishing points for one-point and two-point perspective always occur on the horizon line. Three-point perspective uses an additional vanishing point above 
                    <br>the horizon line. One-point perspective uses a single vanishing point.Your vanishing point will always occur on the horizon line.</p>

                <h2><u>Tutorial</u></h2>
                <p>Two point perspective starts by defining the horizon line.  This line theoretically represents the line that divides the sky from the ground.  However, 
                    <br>with many perspective drawings, this line is implied and instead represents the eye-line or "line of sight" of the viewer. </p>
                <m><img src=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/810083274550280233/810134873859031040/vanishingpointsonthehorizonline.png width="15%" height="15%"></m>

                <p>Once the horizon line has been established, the vanishing points are placed.  The vanishing point is defined as a point placed on the horizon line where objects 
                    <br>begin to disappear because of distance.  A good way to think of the vanishing point is by imagining yourself standing on a beach. Looking both directions, 
                    <br>you can see endlessly down the beach. At some point, people on the beach walking away from you will become progressively smaller until they completely 
                    <br>disappear at the horizon line. </p>
                <p>With two point perspective, two vanishing points are placed on the horizon line.  These two points should be spaced out from each other to prevent distortion.  
                    <br>Both vanishing points need not both be within the picture plane, just as long as they are found on the horizon line, which continues on off of the picture 
                    <br>plane in both directions.</p>
                <m><img src=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/810083274550280233/810134893223739403/twopointperspectivecorner.png width="15%" height="15%"></m>

                <p>Receding lines are next drawn from each end of the corner to each one of the vanishing points.  These lines are called orthogonal lines. Any set of parallel 
                    <br>lines that recede away from the viewer will follow along these lines to one of the vanishing points.</p>
                <m><img src=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/810083274550280233/810134918079578172/recedingorthogonallines.png width="15%" height="15%"></m>

                <p>When a form is placed so that it overlaps the horizon, no additional lines are needed to define the overall form of the object. However, it is important to 
                    <br>note that additional lines do exist. These lines are visible when the subject is placed above the horizon line or below it.</p>
                <m><img src=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/810083274550280233/810134946488254474/backcornerofcube.png width="15%" height="15%"></m>

                <h4>Below the Horizon Line</h4>
                <p>For forms placed below the horizon line the steps remain the same. However, the top of the form will be visible. This means that the top portion of the form will 
                    <br>be defined by the orthogonal lines that extend from each end to the opposite vanishing point.</p>
                <m><img src=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/810083274550280233/810134967085563934/belowthehorizonline.png width="15%" height="15%"></m>

                <h4>Above the Horizon Line</h4>
                <p>For forms placed above the horizon line, the same steps are followed. In this case, the bottom portion of the form is now visible to the viewer. The bottom 
                    <br>portion is defined by extending lines from each end of the cube to the opposite vanishing point.</p>
                <m><img src=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/810083274550280233/810134994889736202/twopointperspectiveabovethehorizonline.png width="15%" height="15%"></m>

                <p>As is the case with the other examples, additional lines (red lines) exist but are not visible in the finished drawing. When complete, all lines that are no 
                    <br>longer needed can be erased revealing the illusion of 3D forms in space.</p>
