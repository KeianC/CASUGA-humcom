                <h4>What is 1 Point Perspective?</h4>
                <p>
                    a mathematical system for representing three-dimensional objects and space on a two-dimensional surface by means of intersecting lines that are drawn 
                    <br>vertically and horizontally and that radiate from one point on a horizon line
                </p>
                <p>Although this definition sounds complicated, the concept is relatively simple. One point perspective is a drawing method that shows how things appear to 
                    <br>get smaller as they get further away, converging towards a single ‘vanishing point’ on the horizon line. It is a way of drawing objects upon a flat 
                    <br>piece of paper (or other drawing surface) so that they look three-dimensional and realistic.</p>

                <p> Drawing in one point perspective is usually appropriate when the subject is viewed ‘front-on’ (such as when looking directly at the face of a cube or the 
                    <br>wall of building) or when looking directly down something long, like a road or railway track. It is popular drawing method with architects and illustrators, 
                    <br>especially when drawing room interiors. To understand more about the history of perspective in art,</p>

                <h2><u>Rules of perspective: true shapes, vanishing points and horizon lines</u></h2>
                <p>In one point perspective, surfaces that face the viewer appear as their true shape, without any distortion. They are drawn using primarily horizontal and 
                    <br>vertical lines, as illustrated by the diagram below:</p>

                <h3>Vanishing Point and Horizon Line</h3>
                <p>The vanishing points for one-point and two-point perspective always occur on the horizon line. Three-point perspective uses an additional vanishing point above 
                    <br>the horizon line. One-point perspective uses a single vanishing point.Your vanishing point will always occur on the horizon line.</p>

                <p>Draw a horizon line.  The horizon line is a horizontal line that will represent eye level in the scene.</p>
                <m><img src=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/810083274550280233/810128797726408775/step-1_horizon_line.png width="15%" height="15%"></m>

                <p>Place a vanishing point on the horizon line.  The vanishing point is going to be the point at which we draw the box back towards</p>
                <m><img src=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/810083274550280233/810129287126581248/step-2_vanishing_point.png width="15%" height="15%"></m>

                <p>Draw the closest side of the box.  This is a square shape.  When learning to draw in perspective you’ll probably find it easiest to draw the 
                    <br>front side first.  This is nothing more than a flat rectangular shape!  Notice in the drawing below the orange lines are perfectly vertical.  
                    <br>One can also see that the blue lines are perfectly horizontal.</p>
                <m><img src=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/810083274550280233/810129308399828992/step-3_front_side.png width="15%" height="15%"></m>

                <p>Connect the appropriate corners to the vanishing point.  This is the magical part about perspective drawing.  Creating these perspective lines 
                    <br>automatically makes the drawing seem more real and three-dimensional!</p>
                <m><img src=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/810083274550280233/810128797726408775/step-1_horizon_line.png width="15%" height="15%"></m>

                <p>End the form.  Nothing goes on forever.  You need to pick a logical place to end the cube.  
                    <br><b>Very Important</b>
                    <br>Notice how these final lines in the back are parallel to their coinciding lines in the front.  The verticals (orange) are vertical in both the 
                    <br>front and rear of the box.  The horizontal lines (blue)  are horizontal in both the front and the rear of the box.</p>
                <m><img src=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/810083274550280233/810129512088076298/step-5_end_form.png width="15%" height="15%"></m>

                <p>When drawing in perspective you’re always going to end up with some extra lines or lines that are too long.  You can draw all lines lightly first 
                    <br>and then ink things later on when you’ve fixed up the drawing.</p>
