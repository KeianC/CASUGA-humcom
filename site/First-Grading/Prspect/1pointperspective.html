                <h4>What is 1 Point Perspective</h4>
                <p>
                    a mathematical system for representing three-dimensional objects and space on a two-dimensional surface by means of intersecting lines that are drawn 
                    <br>vertically and horizontally and that radiate from one point on a horizon line
                </p>
                <p>Although this definition sounds complicated, the concept is relatively simple. One point perspective is a drawing method that shows how things appear to 
                    <br>get smaller as they get further away, converging towards a single ‘vanishing point’ on the horizon line. It is a way of drawing objects upon a flat 
                    <br>piece of paper (or other drawing surface) so that they look three-dimensional and realistic.</p>

                <p> Drawing in one point perspective is usually appropriate when the subject is viewed ‘front-on’ (such as when looking directly at the face of a cube or the 
                    <br>wall of building) or when looking directly down something long, like a road or railway track. It is popular drawing method with architects and illustrators, 
                    <br>especially when drawing room interiors. To understand more about the history of perspective in art,</p>

                <h2><u>History of Perspective in Art</u></h2>
                <h4>Illusion in Art</h4>
                <p>An artist starts with a two-dimensional surface; it may be a wall, a canvas, a board, paper or a pavement. By the use of paint or other media
                    <br>he must make the viewer enter his world and share his vision. But the actual world isn’t two-dimensional and the artist can’t create a three dimensional 
                    <br>world on the surface. How do we get around this problem?</p>
                    
                <p>
                The answer is illusion – to represent the three dimensional world on the two dimensional surface the artist has to use systems of illusion that create the 
                <br>impression of space, of depth and of movement.</p>

                <h4>Art Before Perspective</h4>
                <p>The system of perspective we take for granted today is a relatively recent discovery in artistic history. Before the 14th Century little to no attempts 
                    <br>were made to realistically depict the three dimensional world in art in the way in which we are now accustomed to seeing it.</p>
                
                <p>The art of the Byzantine, Medieval and Gothic periods was rich and beautiful, but the images made no attempt to create the illusion of depth and space.</p>

                <h4>First Perspective – Fillipo Brunelleschi & Masaccio</h4>
                <p>The first known picture to make use of linear perspective was created by the Florentine architect Fillipo Brunelleshi (1377-1446). Painted in 1415, it 
                    <br>depicted the Baptistery in Florence from the front gate of the unfinished cathedral. The linear perspective system projected the illusion of depth onto 
                    <br>a two dimensional plane by use of ‘vanishing points’ to which all lines converged, at eye level, on the horizon. Soon after Brunelleshi’s painting, the 
                    <br>concept caught on and many Italian artists started to use linear perspective in their paintings.</p>
