                <h4>What is a Perspective Art?</h4>
                <p>
                    Linear or point-projection perspective is one of two types of graphical projection perspective in the graphic arts; the other is parallel projection. 
                    <br>Linear perspective is an approximate representation, generally on a flat surface, of an image as it is seen by the eye. In linear perspective,
                    <br>There are 4 major types of perspective defined by the number of primary Vanishing Points lying on the Horizon Line:

                <h2><u>History of Perspective in Art</u></h2>
                <h4>Illusion in Art</h4>
                <p>An artist starts with a two-dimensional surface; it may be a wall, a canvas, a board, paper or a pavement. By the use of paint or other media
                    <br>he must make the viewer enter his world and share his vision. But the actual world isn’t two-dimensional and the artist can’t create a three dimensional 
                    <br>world on the surface. How do we get around this problem?</p>
                    
                <p>
                The answer is illusion – to represent the three dimensional world on the two dimensional surface the artist has to use systems of illusion that create the 
                <br>impression of space, of depth and of movement.</p>

                <h4>Art Before Perspective</h4>
                <p>The system of perspective we take for granted today is a relatively recent discovery in artistic history. Before the 14th Century little to no attempts 
                    <br>were made to realistically depict the three dimensional world in art in the way in which we are now accustomed to seeing it.</p>
                
                <p>The art of the Byzantine, Medieval and Gothic periods was rich and beautiful, but the images made no attempt to create the illusion of depth and space.</p>

                <h4>First Perspective – Fillipo Brunelleschi & Masaccio</h4>
                <p>The first known picture to make use of linear perspective was created by the Florentine architect Fillipo Brunelleshi (1377-1446). Painted in 1415, it 
                    <br>depicted the Baptistery in Florence from the front gate of the unfinished cathedral. The linear perspective system projected the illusion of depth onto 
                    <br>a two dimensional plane by use of ‘vanishing points’ to which all lines converged, at eye level, on the horizon. Soon after Brunelleshi’s painting, the 
                    <br>concept caught on and many Italian artists started to use linear perspective in their paintings.</p>
