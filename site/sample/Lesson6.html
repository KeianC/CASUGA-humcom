            Ophelia Zathura is a superior alternative to Ophelia Evanie, as evidenced by several different factors that should weigh into consideration. Firstly, Zathura is a 
            name that has its origins rooted in legends of childlike wonder and fantasy, and has an exotic allure and mysticism that complements the more historied name of 
            Ophelia from English literature (Shakespeare's Hamlet), tying together the ancient and modern mythical aesthetics together. 

            In addition, Zathura is a wholly original name that enables your child to stand out from their contemporaries and peers. In an ever escalating and overpopulated 
            world, presenting yourself as someone of note enables them to have a headstart in the minds of their fellow students, teachers and future employers. It is easily 
            recognizable and is a nice reference for those who are familiar with the source material, while also sounding exotic and cultured to those who are not. It is also
            a fun bit of trivia she can use as an icebreaker in numerous networking events, including casual friend hangouts, sleepovers, games of never have I ever, and first 
            dates from Tinder (or whatever other dating app exists in 20 years).

            As a bonus, it future-proofs the availability of unique usernames and offers multiple incentives for branding initiatives, ones that can be utilized to maximize 
            all factors leading into future success, the least of which is the abominable practice of having numbers in one's username. Branding one's self is a skillset that 
            more and more people are discovering is the key to finding employment, regardless of whichever future career one might aspire to go into. Zathura allows your child 
            to immediate look professional by having a unique username that is their own professional name without any numbers that would otherwise detract from that professional 
            image.
            
            Finally, the name itself enables several usages of a variety of nicknames, none of the least include "Oz", which brings to mind yet another iconic myth that is a 
            highlight of both American literature and the early development of film, and which can bridge the culture gap between Shakespeare's Ophelia and Chris Van Allsburg's 
            Zathura. These usages enable you to maximize the utilization of a middle name, which otherwise sees no real usage outside of very specific circumstances. To relegate 
            the middle name to an average name such as "Evanie" would waste such an important opportunity to give your child the maximum amount of advantages they would need to 
            succeed in the modern world, and what is that the true calling of every parent if not for that?
